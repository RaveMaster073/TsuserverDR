    Changes the passage status from a given area to another by name or ID. Passages are
    unidirectional, so to change a passage in both directions simultaneously, use /bilock instead.
    If given one area, it will change the passage status FROM the current area TO the given one.
    If given two areas instead, it  will change the passage status FROM the first given area TO
    the second give one (but requires staff role to use).
    Returns an error if the user is unauthorized to create new passages or change existing ones in
    the originating area. In particular, non-staff members are not allowed to create passages
    that did not exist when the areas were loaded or that a staff member did not create before.
