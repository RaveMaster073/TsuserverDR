# *bglock: If false, only moderators can lock the area background; if true, no one can lock it.

#  If true, no such restriction is imposed.
# *change_reachability_allowed: If false, only GM+ may /unilock or /bilock passages affecting

# *has_lights: If false, the area cannot have its lights turned off via /light or similar. If 
#  true, no such restriction is imposed.

#  is a comma-separated list of areas (by name), a passage will be created from this area only to 
#  the listed areas.
# *restricted_chars: If a list of folder names, it prevents non-GMs using said characters from 
#  joining the area, and prompts them to choose another one if they are kicked to the area, they 
#  attempt to switch to that character while in the area, or their character is marked as 
#  restricted while they are in the area.
# *rollp_allowed: If false, only GM+ may /rollp. If true, everyone can /rollp.

#  similar. If true, no such restriction is imposed.

#  a comma-separated list of areas (by name), only said areas can receive /scream messages.
