# TsuserverDR

A Python-based server for Danganronpa Online. It is a fork from [tsuserver3](https://github.com/AttorneyOnline/tsuserver3) which is targeted towards Attorney Online.

Requires Python 3.6-3.8 and PyYAML (follow instructions below to install).

## How to use

### Installing

* Install the latest version of Python. **Python 2 will not work**.
  - You can download Python from its official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  - If your system supports it, it is recommended that you use a separate virtual environment, such as [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for Windows, or [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) for everyone else (it runs itself using Python).
  - If prompted during the installation to add `python` as a PATH environment variable, accept this option.
* Open Command Prompt or your terminal, and change to the directory where you downloaded TsuserverDR to. You can do this in two ways:
  - Go up one folder above the TsuserverDR folder, Shift + right click the TsuserverDR folder, and click `Open command window here`. This is the easiest method.
  - Copy the path of the TsuserverDR folder, open the terminal, and type in `cd "[paste here]"`, excluding the brackets, but including the quotation marks if the path contains spaces.
* To install PyYAML and dependencies, type in the following:
  ```bash
  python -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
  ```
  If you are using Windows and have both Python 2 and 3 installed, you may do the following:
  ```batch
  py -3 -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
  ```
  This operation should not require administrator privileges, unless you decide to remove the `--user` option.
* Rename `config_sample` to `config` and edit the values in the provided YAML files to your liking. Be sure to check the YAML files for syntax errors after you are done. *Use spaces only; do not use tabs.*

### Running

* Run by either double-clicking `start_server.py` or typing in cmd or your terminal `python start_server.py`, or `py -3 start_server.py` if you use both Python 2 and 3. If everything was set up correctly, you will see something like this appear:

\[2019-12-31T10:20:20\]: Starting...  
\[2019-12-31T10:20:20\]: Launching TsuserverDR 4.2.3 (191231a)...  
\[2019-12-31T10:20:20\]: Loading server configurations...  
\[2019-12-31T10:20:20\]: Server configurations loaded successfully!  
\[2019-12-31T10:20:20\]: Starting a nonlocal server...  
\[2019-12-31T10:20:20\]: Server started successfully!  
\[2019-12-31T10:20:21\]: Server should be now accessible from 192.0.2.0:50000:My First DR Server  

* If you are listing your server in the Attorney Online master server, make sure its details are set up correctly. In particular, make sure that your server name and description are correct, as that is how players will find your server. If everything was set up correctly, you will see something like this appear:

\[2019-12-31T10:20:21\]: Attempting to connect to the master server at master.aceattorneyonline.com:27016 with the following details:  
\[2019-12-31T10:20:21\]: *Server name: My First DR Server  
\[2019-12-31T10:20:21\]: *Server description: This is my flashy new DR server  
\[2019-12-31T10:20:22\]: Connected to the master server.  

  - The server will make a single ping to [ipify](https://api.ipify.org) in order to obtain its public IP address. If during launch you get  `urllib.error.URLError` or `socket.gaierror`, there is probably something wrong with your internet connection.
  - Successful connection or getting a spot in the master server list does not imply that your server will be accessible to other players. In particular, you must make sure that your external port in `config\config.yaml` is open and accepting connections, which usually involves a combination of router and firewall settings. In case of doubt, you can use websites such as [Can You See Me](https://canyouseeme.org) to check if your port is visible.

* To stop the server, press Ctrl+C once from your terminal. This will initiate a shutdown sequence and notify you when it is done. If the shutdown finished successfully, you will see something like this appear:

\[2019-12-31T22:23:04\]: You have initiated a server shut down.  
\[2019-12-31T22:23:04\]: Kicking 12 remaining clients.  
\[2019-12-31T22:23:04\]: Server has successfully shut down.  

* If you do not see anything after a few seconds of starting a shutdown, you can try spamming Ctrl+C to try and force a shutdown or directly close out your terminal. This is not recommended due to the cleanup process not finishing correctly but it is doable.

* To restart a server, you can follow the steps outlined above to shut down and then start the server again.

* In the unlikely event that there is an error during runtime, the server will do its best to print out to your terminal a complete traceback of the error with some additional information, as well as a more complete log file in the `logs` folder with the error timestamp, to help with debugging. Depending on the nature of the error, the server may or may not be able to continue execution normally after such an error happens.

### Updating

* If you already have a version of TsuserverDR or tsuserver installed and wish to update to a new version, you can download the new version and then overwrite your previously existing files. Do note that you do not need to shut down your server before overwriting the files, but you must restart it from console in order for changes to take effect.

  - This process will not overwrite your server configurations inside the `config` folder, your existing logs inside the `logs` folder, or the user information inside the `storage` folder. However, it will overwrite other files including the Python files inside the `server` folder. Therefore, make sure to save backups of those files before overwriting in case you have modified them and wish to keep an archive of your changes.

* If you want to update **Python** itself, you can get the latest Python download [from their website here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and then follow the instructions under the Installing section in this readme. To check your current version of Python, you can run ``python`` on its own and look at the first line. The latest stable major Python release is *Python 3.8* as of October 31, 2019.

  - Please follow the installation instructions again even if you had successfully ran a server before, because your new Python installation may be missing libraries that TsuserverDR expects there to exist. You should not need to change any server configuration files though.
  - In general, updating to a Python version beyond what is specified as supported may lead to unstable behavior, so for active servers try to keep your Python version among the ones specifically labeled as supported.

### Notes

* **Note 1**: the commands may refer to the following identifiers for a player:
    - **Character Name**: the folder name of the character the player is using, also the name that appears in /getarea.
    - **HDID**: the hard drive ID of the player, accessible through /whois (requires community manager rank)
    - **ID**: number in brackets [] in /getarea.
    - **IPID**: number in parentheses () in /getarea (requires community manager rank).
    - **IP**: the IP address of the player.
    - **OOC Name**: the username of the player in the OOC chat.
* **Note 2**: some commands include commas (,) between the parameters. If that is the case, the command expects you to actually use the commas between the parameters. If for whatever reason your parameter also has a comma followed by a space, you can include it by using ,\ (so 'Hello, world' becomes 'Hello,\ world').
* **Note 3**: additional documentation for the commands can be found in `config\commands.py` and consulting the docstrings. For example, to get additional information for /help, you would look for `ooc_cmd_help` and look for the associated text.
